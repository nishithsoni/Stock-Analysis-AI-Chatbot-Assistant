## What it does

The Stock Analysis Chatbot Assistant is a powerful tool that offers real-time stock information and analytical insights. Users can effortlessly access the latest stock prices, calculate moving averages, determine the Relative Strength Index (RSI), and evaluate the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for their chosen stocks. Additionally, the chatbot provides visual representation through stock price charts, making it an invaluable resource for investors and traders seeking to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of finance. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model, this chatbot delivers a seamless and conversational user experience, bridging the gap between financial data and user-friendly accessibility.

## How we built it

The Stock Analysis Chatbot Assistant was developed through a blend of cutting-edge technologies and processes. It harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for understanding and generating conversational responses. Python serves as the backbone, with Streamlit, Pandas, yfinance, and Matplotlib forming the toolkit for data manipulation, UI design, and stock data visualization. Integration with APIs like Yahoo Finance enables real-time data retrieval, while custom functions handle stock-related queries. The chatbot's conversational flow and robust error handling ensure a seamless user experience. Extensive testing, feedback-driven iterations, and deployment on web hosting platforms complete the development process, delivering a user-friendly and informative tool for stock market enthusiasts.
